Every year the country celebrates thanksgiving and then goes out to splurge on Black Friday.
Every year companies use all tricks in playbook plus some to ring in more dollars.
Every year consumers buy more clothes, more TVs, more crap than the previous year.
The wheels of capitalism keep turning with no regard for the environment.

Climate change is real and consumers have huge environmental impact
We like to blame the government or industries for the Earth's problems, but in reality it is all derived from consumption.
Most goods are not biodegradable and inevitably end up in landfills.

Reduce > Reuse > Recycle
While the first instinct with waste is to recycle, it is better to reuse and best to reduce. 
This black friday - <b>Please Buy Less</b> :)
